# My Website

This is my personal and research website, built on `jekyll` and pulled largely from [Ryan Abernathey](https://github.com/rabernat/rabernat.github.io).

## Publishing

github pages doesn't support third party plugins. I need to use the
bibliography plugin. So I am publishing statically using these instructions
http://ixti.net/software/2013/01/28/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html

to publish: `rake publish`
