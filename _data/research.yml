  description: "Hydroclimate systems vary on many time scales, causing the weather patterns that generate extreme events to cluster in space and time. Large uncertainties are inherent to the prediction of future climate risk since the extent of greenhouse forcing, the climate response, and the needs of society all carry some uncertainty of their own.  On shorter time scales, however, low-frequency modes of climate variability still dominate climate risk. I'm working on diagnostics to identify the physical mechanisms that cause high-impact events in a particular place, and that cause clusters of high-impact events in space and time."

  description: "Managing climate risk depends on its prediction on many spatial and temporal scales. I'm working to develop tools for the assessment of existing prediction schemes in order to understand their limitations. I'm also working to develop physically informed, probabilistic models models in order to make projections of events that current methods do not credibly resolve."

  description: "We need to make decisions despite large uncertainties. I'm particularly interested in how to assess whether a large, structural project (like a dam) or a sequence of flexible, nonstructural projects (like insurance policies and zoning changes) may best manage climate risk. I'm working to develop tools which use the prediction schemes described above in order to optimize the timing, sequencing, and scale of investments in climate risk mitigation."
