  </header>
  <div>
<p>My name is James and I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://eee.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Earth and Environmental Engineering</a> Department at Columbia University.
I'm affiliated with the <a href="https://water.columbia.edu" target="_blank">Columbia Water Center</a>, which my adviser <a href="https://columbia.edu/~ula2" target="_blank">Upmanu Lall</a> directs.
If I'm not in the office, you can probably hear me yelling my support for <a href="https://twitter.com/albirroja?lang=en" target="_blank">La Albirroja</a>, <a href="https://www.chiesaditotti.com/" target="_blank">A.S. Roma</a>, and <a href="http://clubsportivoluqueno.com.py/" target="_blank">Sportivo Luqueño</a>, or explaining why New Haven <a href="https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/An-upcoming-film-celebrates-New-Haven-s-holy-12576171.php" target="_blank">apizza</a> is better than the New York stuff.</p>
<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>We know that the climate is changing, but the needs of society are also changing in important -- and often unpredictable -- ways.
Urbanization, population growth, and shifts in technology all affect the ways in which society is exposed to water and climate extremes such as droughts, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires.</p>
<p>One way to manage the risks associated with these events is by building large and permanent infrastructure projects, such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maeslantkering" target="_blank">giant sea wall</a> or a dam.
However, these projects often have large environmental and social costs.
Further, once they are built it is difficult to change their size, location, or construction, and as a consequence they may perform poorly if the future climate is not what the structure was designed for, or if the needs of society shift in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>The overarching goal of my research is to develop methods for identifying when it makes sense to build large and permanent structures to manage climate risk, and when a portfolio or smaller and more flexible projects may be preferable.
This question depends heavily on projections of future climate, so I also work on understanding the physical mechanisms that control water and climate risk, and on predicting how they may change in the future.
Consequently, my work seeks to integrate principles from the fields of statistics, machine learning, optimization, operations research, hydrology, and climate dynamics.
I also enjoy considering ideas from the social sciences, humanities, and philosophy because I believe that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge  <br>
-- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/68927-the-greatest-enemy-of-knowledge-is-not-ignorance-it-is" target="blank">Daniel J. Boorstin</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why I Do It</h2>
<p>Growing up in the United States, I never thought much about having access to sufficient quantities of clean and safe drinking water.
So, when the <a href="http://www.fundacionparaguaya.org.py/?lang=en" target="_blank">Fundación Paraguaya</a> gave me the opportunity to work with them on a water access project in rural Paraguay, I assumed that the technical challenges would be within my grasp.
Although I found I could understand calculations such as sizing pipes and motors or dosing chlorine, so could the people who operated and depended on the small systems!
Instead, three months traveling around the country highlighted both the resilience and ingenuity of ordinary people, but also the vulnerability that societies face to external shocks such as prolonged drought, aquifer contamination, and economic collapse.
Other water-related experiences in the US, Ethiopia, Cameroon, and Brazil have emphasized this point.</p>
<p>I love to develop quantitative and data-intensive tools so that I can better examine human-environment systems, probe where catastrophic events could happen, and look for solutions that reduce those risks.
Research is always incremental, and I know that making even a dent in the huge collective challenges we face will require collaboration and luck, but if you're interested in these ideas I'd love to talk further!</p>
<h2>Contact Me</h2>
<p>The best way to contact me is through e-mail: <a href="mailto:james.doss-gollin@columbia.edu">james.doss-gollin@columbia.edu</a>.
I'm also active <a href="http://twitter.com/jdossgollin" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>, and you can use any of the social icons on the navigation menu.
I look forward to hearing from you!</p>  </div>
