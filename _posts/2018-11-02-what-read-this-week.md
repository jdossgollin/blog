As Physics professor Raghuveer Parthasarathy of U Oregon writes in his NSF "big idea" [proposal](https://eighteenthelephant.wordpress.com/2018/10/30/whats-the-big-idea-science/), writes, "over 2 million scientific papers are published each year, about one-sixth of which are from the United States, representing both a steady increase in our understanding of the universe and a barrage of noise driven by pressures to generate output".
Rather than try anu mitigation here -- I don't exactly run the show -- I'm going to focus on adaptation!
Specifically, I'm starting a new series of weekly (I'll try) blog posts on interesting papers that I read.

<!--more-->

Obviously, the papers here will reflect what I'm reading, which relates mostly to water, climate, risk management, engineering, etc.
Don't expect critical reviews of psychology or medicine studies!
In fact, don't expect too many critical reviews at all: this is a blog, not peer review, so my goal is to identify some interesting ideas in these papers rather than dig into their methods and references.

I also aim to keep these posts short (my goal is to [digest ideas](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/), not add to the noise).
I **hope** to bring other people into the conversation; either in the comments on these posts (I'm not 100% sold on Disqus), or by other people creating their own reading reviews (if you want to use this web site I'm open to that), or by taking the conversation to Twitter / wherever.
**As always**, if you are having trouble accessing one of the papers I link to, please let me know and I'll be happy to send you a PDF!

## Let's Dive In

I started this week by refreshing [some](10.1198/000313008X332421) of my [favorite](https://doi.org/10.1198/000313006X152649) papers on statistics and interpretation of $$p$$-values for a paper I was reviewing.
I also read some interesting [papers](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420917302741) and [reports](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/29623) on managing water and climate risk.
I even saw [Lee and Sheridan](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-018-0051-7) use [weather](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0805.1) [types](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0115.1) to assess how weather patterns have changed in space and time.

However, the paper I want to highlight this week is "An interdisciplinary research agenda to explore the
unintended consequences of structural flood protection" by _Di Baldassarre et al_, [published in HESS Opinions](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5629-2018).

I think of myself as someone who thinks about risk (i.e., flood risk) through a "systems" lens, but I don't spend very much time thinking about human psychology or how we make decisions.
In this paper, _Di Baldassarre et al_ describe the "levee effect", sketched below, in which "increasing levels of flood protection can also be associated with unexpected increases in flood exposure."

Of course, the levee effect isn't new.
However, this review paper nicely summarizes what we know about this effect: "flood risk can even increase in the mediumâ€“long term after the introduction or reinforcement of a structural flood protection".
These effects can be large: a study of the Netherlands "showed that the urban area that can be potentially flooded has increased six-fold during the 20th century".
_Di Baldassarre et al_ cite other studies which document this effect, in some form, all around the world.

Unfortunately, our knowledge of this subject is based on fragmented studies, which use different data and different methods.
The latter part of the article asks what methods and data we would need to better understand and model the levee effects.
Unfortunately, we can't generate "reliable long-term information on exposure and vulnerability in the focus areas" overnight, which means that even if we began collecting perfect data everywhere right now, we can still only learn from places that have long data sets.
It's worth asking whether tradeoffs that people in fast-growing cities like Lagos, Mumbai, and Sao Paulo make might differ from what we can learn from the case studies cited, which are mostly in Germany and Italy.
I think we should also be wary of drawing too much inference from agent-based models, since they represent humans (and all our complexity and unpredictability) using relatively simple models.
Like all models, agent-based models are useful for identifying some outcomes that _can_ occur, but may not be able to tell us exactly what _will_ occur, particularly when we have such limited data to use for training these models.

_Di Baldassarre et al_ wrap up by writing that better understanding of these processes "will improve our ability to assess and explain changes in flood risk.
Also, it will provide more empirical evidence supporting the selection of strategies and measures for flood risk reduction."
I fully agree.
As an engineer I often think about projects (i.e, flood risk mitigation projects) as a cost-benefit assessment, in which the benefits should consider the value of property protected and new economic development allowed.
This review paper highlights that we should also consider how these effects will change the potential costs.
As we continue to learn about feedback loops in the levee effect, we should consider combining structural flood protection with policies, such as strict zoning or mandates for insurance, that can help keep our exposure in check.
