This page contains a list of my published papers.
You can also visit the following sites, which *should* have updated information:

* [My CV](https://jamesdossgollin.me/fullcv/CV_Doss-Gollin_James.pdf) has a complete list of academic papers, conference papers, and presentations.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6ifLBBsAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="blank"}
* [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3428-2224){:target="_blank"}
* [ResearcherID](https://researcherid.com/rid/J-4273-2014){:target="_blank"}

I have tried to post post-prints or open access versions where available.
However, paywalls sometimes get in our way.
**If you would like a copy of a paper** but are not able to access it because of paywalls, please [email me](mailto:james-dossgollin@columbia.edu) and I'll be delighted to send you a copy!
