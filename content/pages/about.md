I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Earth and Environmental Engineering](https://eee.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} Department at Columbia University advised by [Upmanu Lall](https://columbia.edu/~ula2){:target="_blank"}.
If I'm not in the office, you can probably hear me yelling my support for [La Albirroja](https://twitter.com/albirroja?lang=en){:target="_blank"}, [A.S. Roma](https://www.chiesaditotti.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [Sportivo Luqueño](http://clubsportivoluqueno.com.py/){:target="_blank"}, or explaining why New Haven [apizza](https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/An-upcoming-film-celebrates-New-Haven-s-holy-12576171.php){:target="_blank"} is better than the New York knockoffs.

## What I Do

I work on designing and managing resilient infrastructure systems under uncertainty.
Some topics I'm currently working on include:

* Process-based diagnostics of climate predictions
* Real options analysis and sequential planning
* Identifying the distribution of climate risk in space, time, and across populations
* Financial risk hedging and other nonstructural risk mitigation instruments

If you are interested in these areas I would be delighted to discuss how we can collaborate!

## Why I Do It

Growing up in the United States, I never thought much about having access to sufficient quantities of clean and safe drinking water.
So, when the [Fundación Paraguaya](http://www.fundacionparaguaya.org.py/?lang=en){:target="_blank"} gave me the opportunity to work with them on a water access project in rural Paraguay, I assumed that the technical challenges would be within my grasp.
Although I found I could understand calculations such as sizing pipes and motors or dosing chlorine, so could the people who operated and depended on the small systems!
Instead, three months traveling around the country highlighted both the resilience and ingenuity of ordinary people, but also the vulnerability that societies face to external shocks such as prolonged drought, aquifer contamination, and economic collapse.
Other water-related experiences in the US, Ethiopia, Cameroon, and Brazil have emphasized this point.

I love to develop quantitative and data-intensive tools so that I can better examine human-environment systems, probe where catastrophic events could happen, and look for solutions that reduce those risks.
Research is always incremental, and I know that making even a dent in the huge collective challenges we face will require collaboration and luck, but if you're interested in these ideas I'd love to talk further!
