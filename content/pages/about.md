My name is James and I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Earth and Environmental Engineering](https://eee.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} Department at Columbia University.
I'm affiliated with the [Columbia Water Center](https://water.columbia.edu){:target="_blank"}, which my adviser [Upmanu Lall](https://columbia.edu/~ula2){:target="_blank"} directs.
If I'm not in the office, you can probably hear me yelling my support for [La Albirroja](https://twitter.com/albirroja?lang=en){:target="_blank"}, [A.S. Roma](https://www.chiesaditotti.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [Sportivo Luqueño](http://clubsportivoluqueno.com.py/){:target="_blank"}, or explaining why New Haven [apizza](https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/An-upcoming-film-celebrates-New-Haven-s-holy-12576171.php){:target="_blank"} is better than the New York stuff.

## What I Do

My work focuses on planning water systems and managing hydroclimate risk under uncertainty.
This is a fascinating question which has led me through many distinct disciplines.
For example, decision theory and operations research inform how we make decisions under uncertainty, and also how we approximate these decision-making processes so that we can solve them computationally.
Climate science and hydrology determine the structure of the uncertainties that we wish to manage, such as the probability of flood or drought far in the future.
We can't answer these questions perfectly, but science can help us understand what is plausible.
Statistics also informs how we estimate these probabilities, and is particularly useful for combining data and estimates from distinct sources -- each of which has its own advantages and limitations.
Ideas from the social sciences, humanities, and philosophy are also key because

## Why I Do It

Growing up in the United States, I never thought much about having access to sufficient quantities of clean and safe drinking water.
So, when the [Fundación Paraguaya](http://www.fundacionparaguaya.org.py/?lang=en){:target="_blank"} gave me the opportunity to work with them on a water access project in rural Paraguay, I assumed that the technical challenges would be within my grasp.
Although I found I could understand calculations such as sizing pipes and motors or dosing chlorine, so could the people who operated and depended on the small systems!
Instead, three months traveling around the country highlighted both the resilience and ingenuity of ordinary people, but also the vulnerability that societies face to external shocks such as prolonged drought, aquifer contamination, and economic collapse.
Other water-related experiences in the US, Ethiopia, Cameroon, and Brazil have emphasized this point.

I love to develop quantitative and data-intensive tools so that I can better examine human-environment systems, probe where catastrophic events could happen, and look for solutions that reduce those risks.
Research is always incremental, and I know that making even a dent in the huge collective challenges we face will require collaboration and luck, but if you're interested in these ideas I'd love to talk further!
