The best way to contact me is through e-mail: [james.doss-gollin@columbia.edu](mailto:james.doss-gollin@columbia.edu).

You can also find me enthusiastically posting about water, energy, transit, and soccer [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/jdossgollin){:target="_blank"}, uploading poorly organized repositories to [GitHub](https://github.com/jdossgollin){:target="_blank"}, or occasionally updating my profile on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdossgollin/){:target="_blank"}.

I look forward to hearing from you.
